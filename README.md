# British Airways Data Transformation

This project implements a modern data transformation pipeline for British Airways, designed to process and model customer review data from [Airline Quality](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways/). It leverages **dbt**, **Snowflake**, and **Apache Airflow**, orchestrated via **Astronomer**, to create a scalable, production-ready workflow.

## üß± Data Architecture

### 1. Data Source
Customer reviews are scraped from [AirlineQuality.com](https://www.airlinequality.com/airline-reviews/british-airways/), capturing structured and unstructured data elements including:

- **Flight Route** (e.g., *Singapore to Sydney*)  
- **Aircraft Type** (e.g., *Boeing 777*)
- **Seat Type** (e.g., *Business Class*)  
- **Type of Traveller** (e.g., *Solo Leisure*)  
- **Date Flown** (e.g., *March 2025*) 
- **Star Ratings** (Seat Comfort, Cabin Staff, Food & Beverages, Entertainment, Ground Service, Value for Money)  
- **Review Text** and **Submission Date**  
- **Verification Flag** (Trip Verified)  
- **Reviewer Info** (Name, Country, Number of Reviews)
--- 

### 2. Data Model

#### Dimension Tables
- `dim_customer`: Identity, loyalty, and flight history  
- `dim_aircraft`: Manufacturer, model, and seating layout  
- `dim_location`: Airports, cities, and time zones  
- `dim_date`: Calendar and fiscal date tracking  

#### Fact Table
- `fct_review`: One row per customer review per flight  
  - Includes metrics (ratings), booleans (verified, recommended), and categorical fields (seat type, travel type)

### 3. Data Flow
- **Source Layer**: Web scraping + staging  
- **Transformation Layer**: dbt modeling + business logic  
- **Orchestration Layer**: DAG scheduling and task dependency management via **Astronomer**  
- **Presentation Layer**: Clean fact/dim tables for BI/reporting

### 4. Data Quality Framework
- Null checks  
- Foreign key validation  
- Freshness and completeness monitoring  
- dbt tests for schema integrity and logic rules

## üåê Data Modeling Approach

## Data Model Overview

### **Step 1: Business Processes**
Business processes represent real-world events that generate measurable data. For British Airways, the core business process is the **collection of customer flight reviews**. Each review submitted by a customer reflects their experience on a specific flight and becomes a fact event. These reviews include detailed ratings on various service categories, forming the backbone of our analytical layer.

### **Step 2: Define the Grain**
The grain defines the level of detail stored in the fact table. For this model, the grain is defined as:

> **One customer review per flight.**

Each row in the `fct_review` table represents a unique review event containing metrics tied to a specific customer‚Äôs flight experience. This atomic grain ensures consistency and supports granular performance analysis across multiple service touchpoints.

### **Step 3: Dimensions for Descriptive Context**
Dimension tables provide the **who, what, where, when** context for interpreting facts.

- **Who:** `dim_customer` ‚Äî describes the reviewer through `customer_name`, `nationality`, and `number_of_flights`.
- **What:** `dim_aircraft` ‚Äî provides context on the aircraft via `aircraft_model`, `aircraft_manufacturer`, and `seat_capacity`.
- **Where:** `dim_location` ‚Äî captures the origin, destination, and transit points, using a combination of `city` and `airport_name`.
- **When:** `dim_date` ‚Äî captures both `date_flown` and `date_submitted` and supports calendar and financial date logic (`cal_year`, `fin_quarter`, etc.).

### **Step 4: Facts for Measurement**
Facts are the **quantitative outputs** from the review process, collected per flight review:

- **Ratings:**  
  `seat_comfort`, `cabin_staff_service`, `food_and_beverages`, `inflight_entertainment`, `ground_service`, `wifi_and_connectivity`, `value_for_money`

- **Booleans:**  
  `verified`, `recommended`

- **Categorical Descriptions:**  
  `seat_type`, `type_of_traveller`, `review_text`

These facts represent real customer input and form the foundation for performance dashboards, KPIs, and customer sentiment insights.

## ‚≠ê Star Schema Overview

This model follows a classic **star schema** structure where the `fct_review` table sits at the center and joins to dimension tables via foreign keys:

| Foreign Key in `fct_review`      | Dimension Table      | Description                            |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `customer_id`                    | `dim_customer`        | Links each review to a specific customer |
| `date_submitted_id` / `date_flown_id` | `dim_date`       | Supports dual-date tracking (when submitted vs when flown) |
| `origin_location_id`, `destination_location_id`, `transit_location_id` | `dim_location` | Connects review to flight locations |
| `aircraft_id`                    | `dim_aircraft`        | Captures aircraft-related context |

![schema](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6276b06-9f03-410a-b2cc-785b0a23b8f2)

This schema supports efficient slicing, filtering, and aggregating reviews by date, location, customer, and aircraft, enabling detailed insights across British Airways‚Äô customer experience.
